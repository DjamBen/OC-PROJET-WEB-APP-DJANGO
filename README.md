                }
            }

## Using the program


### 1 - Launch

    1 - activation of the virtual environment in the base directory:

        source env/bin/activate

    2 - access to the litreview directory:

        cd litreview/

    3 - Launching the Django server

        ./manage.py runserver

    4 - Opening a web page
    
        Address: 127.0.0.1:8000

### 2 - Use

    In order to test the site, 5 fictitious users are registered with some tickets and reviews
    in the "db.sqlite3" database made available in the repository:

        - leon28
        - jean35

        the password for users: P@ssword1


    To have an initial database:

        1 - Stop the Django server by performing the combination:
                
                 control+c

        2 - Delete the "db.sqlite3" file

        3 - migrate to the new database

                ./manage.py makemigrations => This creates a file in litreview/review/migrations
              
### Creating a user

    On the 'Connection' page accessible from the address "127.0.0.1:8000", a "register" button allows
    to access the 'Registration' page.

    On this page, we enter a name which will be the identifier and a password twice to confirm it.
    This password must have at least 8 characters, a capital letter, a number and a special character.

###  Use of the site

- The Feeds page:

    -   Once the user is logged in, the "feed" page is displayed.

        The user can create a ticket to request a review of a book or
        directly make a review by creating the ticket followed by the review.

        A feed of tickets and reviews is displayed by creation date in descending order.
        these are the user's tickets and reviews or those of followed users.

        If a ticket does not have a corresponding review, it is possible to make one.

        When a ticket has had a review, it no longer appears in the feed. It appears directly in the review.
        It is then no longer possible to add a review to this ticket.


    - The Post page:

        This page displays all of the user's tickets and reviews.
        It is then possible to modify these posts or delete them.

        If a ticket containing a review is deleted, then the review is also deleted.

        If a review is deleted, it will then be possible to perform a review again.


    - The Subscription page:

        This page allows the management of followed users.

        You can add a user by entering his name or unsubscribe from this user.

        By following a user, we see the posts created by this user and thus respond to tickets.
